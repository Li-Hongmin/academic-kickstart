# A matlab project template for clustering research

After I finished a research paper on clustering, I found the project management is very important to ensure that the project can smoothly go.


That's why I need a project template so that I can repeatly use it to conduct experiments in a short period.

Here is a mindmap of this project. 
I create a clear structure to manage source code and the results.

In additon, the project can automatically generate latex tables to show the results.

The todolist is very usefull during conducting experiments, which lets you make sure which step you are working for.
